## **Description**  <!-- omit in toc -->
Atelier is a front-facing e-commerce web portal that allows users to view details of specific clothing products. Whether you're interested in different styles, want to see different products, ask questions, or leave a review, Atelier provides a fast and intuitive experience. The page can be broken down into 4 main modules: Overview, Related Products, Questions-And-Answers, and Reviews Module.

### **Overivew Module**
The overview module allows users to examine the product further. Users can view different styles of the product, expand the product image, and add to the cart if interested.

### **Related-Products Module**
The related products feature displays other products a customer might be interested in, based on the one currently selected.
- Click the star icon to view a comparison of any related item to the one currently being viewed.

Also included in this module is an "outfit" feature which allows a customer to build a look by adding and removing products of interest.
- Click "Add to Outfit" to add the item currently being viewed to the outfit list.
- Click the "x" button in the top-right corner of any outfit item to remove it from the list.

### **Questions-And-Answers Module**
The Questions-And-Answers module allows users to query questions and answers related to the product. It sorts both questions and answers by usefulness as well as includes a search bar for specific keywords to streamline the FAQ process. Additionally, there is also a report and thumbs-up feature so that the community can engage and filter valuable and related Q&As

### **Reviews Module**
The reviews module provides an accurate star rating for the product, sorts the reviews list by various criteria, and allows users to submit their own thoughts about the product.
