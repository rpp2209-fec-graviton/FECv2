## Description
Project Atelier is an updated client-facing retail web-portal that allows users to view details of specific clothing products. This project can be broken up into four main components: Overview, Related-Products, Questions-And-Answers, and Reviews.

### Overivew Module
The overview module allows users to examine the product further. Users can view different styles of the product, expand the product image, and selecting 

### Related-Products Module
The related products feature displays other products a customer might be interested in, based on the one currently selected.
- Click the star icon to view a comparison of any related item to the one currently being viewed.

Also included in this module is an "outfit" feature which allows a customer to build a look by adding and removing products of interest.
- Click "Add to Outfit" to add the item currently being viewed to the outfit list.
- Click the "x" button in the top-right corner of any outfit item to remove it from the list.

### Questions-And-Answers Module
The Questions-And-Answers module allows users to query questions and answers related to the product. It sorts both questions and answers by usefulness, allows querying for specific questions, and allows users to submit their own questions and answers. 

### Reviews Module
The reviews module provides an accurate star rating for the product, sorts reviews list by various criterias, and allows users to submit their own thoughts about the product.
